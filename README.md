# Luma

Luma is a productivity app that’s all about simplicity, speed, and ease of use. It helps you manage tasks, stay organized, and make progress on your goals. Luma also works alongside the Effortless Quest website, which gamifies your work and daily tasks, making it easier to stay motivated and get things done.

## Features
- AI Assistant: Luma includes a built-in AI assistant that stores all data locally. Users can train and personalize their AI, and all data remains on their device, as nothing is sent anywhere. The AI is trained to have conversations, retain memories, and retrain itself based on interactions, notes, and instructions provided by the user.
- Task Automation: The AI can automate tasks inside the web browser, with capabilities to connect and automate Google Sheets and Notion files, making workflow management more efficient.
- Session Reminders: Luma allows users to submit session reminders that they can check off during the current session.
- Voice Memos and Notes: Record voice memos and take notes within the app to stay organized.
- Excalidraw Integration: A built-in browser displaying Excalidraw allows users to create diagrams for visual planning and brainstorming.
- Planning and Deep Thinking: Luma assists with planning, thinking, organizing, brainstorming, and deep thinking by helping users structure their ideas and tasks.
